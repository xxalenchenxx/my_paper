          The difference between calculated theoretical (33.3%) and measured achieved occupancy (2.1%) can be the       
          result of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can   
          occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices   
          Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#occupancy) for more details on     
          optimizing occupancy.

          The 4.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 12. This kernel's theoretical occupancy (33.3%) is limited by the number of blocks that   
          can fit on the SM. This kernel's theoretical occupancy (33.3%) is limited by the required amount of shared    
          memory.

          occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices
